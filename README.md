# 00Scripts

This is just an assortment of scripts written in Matlab. They don't really do anything special. 

CensusAnalysis pulls some census data and fits a polynomial model using an OLS method I think. This was a problem for a class

M426453 uses a Newton method for nonlinear systems to fit a model in a similar way -- I'm not sure where this code came from
  
I'm going to assume Monte_Carlo426 was written to do some Monte Carlo simulations. 

More census is more census. I think this just fits an exponential model instead of a polynomial model

The samplevar's are actually functions. No clue how they ended up here. They just calculate variances. I think this was one of the first
  things I did in Matlab
